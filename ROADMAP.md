- **Downtime**: Multi-region deployment, 99.9% SLA

### Economic Risks
- **Token volatility**: Allow payment in stablecoins (USDC)
- **Low liquidity**: Liquidity mining incentives
- **Regulation**: Legal review, comply with securities laws

### Business Risks
- **Slow adoption**: Aggressive marketing, developer grants
- **Competition**: Focus on developer experience, unique features
- **Trust**: Transparent reputation, escrow for payments
