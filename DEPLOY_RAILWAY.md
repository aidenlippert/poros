# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up for Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub (free $5 credit, no credit card required)
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Install Railway CLI (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
# OR
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 3: Deploy from GitHub

**Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://railway.app/new
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Push this repo to GitHub first:
   ```bash
   cd /home/rocz/agenticwebbeta
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Agent Web Marketplace"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentweb.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
5. Select your repo from Railway
6. Railway will auto-detect Python and deploy!

**Option B: Railway CLI (Faster)**
```bash
cd /home/rocz/agenticwebbeta

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy!
railway up

# Get your URL
railway domain
```

### Step 4: Wait 2-3 Minutes
Railway will:
- ‚úÖ Install Python 3.11
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Run the Procfile (starts chat_ui.py)
- ‚úÖ Assign you a public URL: `your-app-name.up.railway.app`

### Step 5: Test It!
Open the URL Railway gives you and you're LIVE! üéâ

## Current Limitations (We'll Fix These Next)

### What Works Now
- ‚úÖ Chat UI is accessible
- ‚úÖ Basic scraping, analysis, summarization
- ‚úÖ Flight search
- ‚úÖ Conversational interface

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- ‚ùå DHT/P2P agent discovery (needs multiple services running)
- ‚ùå Bootstrap node (not running on Railway yet)
- ‚ùå Agent-to-agent communication (localhost only)

### The Problem
Right now, all the agents (web scraper, analyzer, flight search) are trying to connect to `127.0.0.1` (localhost), which won't work in Railway's environment.

---

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Single Service Mode (Simplest)
Run ALL agents in one process (monolith):
- Chat UI
- Web scraper
- Data analyzer
- Summarizer
- Flight search

**Pros:** Works immediately on Railway
**Cons:** Not truly decentralized

### Option 2: Railway Multi-Service (Better)
Deploy each agent as a separate Railway service:
- Service 1: Bootstrap Node (DHT hub)
- Service 2: Chat UI + Orchestrator
- Service 3: Web Scraper Agent
- Service 4: Data Analyzer Agent
- Service 5: Summarizer Agent
- Service 6: Flight Search Agent

**Pros:** True decentralized architecture
**Cons:** Uses more Railway resources ($$$)

### Option 3: Hybrid (Best for Now)
- Chat UI + all agents in one Railway service (monolith)
- Later: split out to microservices when we have users

---

## Recommended: Deploy Option 1 First

Let me create a **single-service** version that will work on Railway immediately:

```python
# start_all.py - Run everything in one process

import asyncio
import threading
from examples.marketplace_demo import chat_ui
from examples.marketplace_demo import web_scraper_agent
from examples.marketplace_demo import data_analyzer_agent
from examples.marketplace_demo import content_summarizer_agent
from examples.marketplace_demo import flight_search_agent

# Start all agents in background threads
# Start Flask app in main thread
```

**This will work on Railway RIGHT NOW.**

Want me to create this? It'll be live in 10 minutes! üöÄ

## After Railway Deploy

### Add a Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Buy domain: marketplace.agentweb.io
2. In Railway dashboard: Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. Add custom domain
4. Update DNS: CNAME ‚Üí your-app.up.railway.app
5. Railway auto-handles HTTPS! ‚úÖ

### Monitor Usage
- Railway free tier: $5/month credit
- Estimated usage: ~$2-3/month (should be free!)
- Upgrade to $5/month plan when you get users

### Scale Up
When you hit 1000+ users:
- Upgrade Railway plan
- Split into microservices
- Add Redis caching
- Add PostgreSQL database
