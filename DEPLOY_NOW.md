- `start_railway.py` - All-in-one service (no DHT required)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Step 1: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/rocz/agenticwebbeta

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment - Agent Web Marketplace MVP"

# Create repo on GitHub
# Go to https://github.com/new
# Name: agentweb (or your choice)
# Keep it PUBLIC (required for Railway free tier)
# Don't initialize with README (we have one)

# Link to your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentweb.git

# Push!
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy on Railway (3 minutes)

### Option A: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

8. **DONE!** üéâ

### Option B: Railway CLI (If you prefer terminal)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Make sure `requirements.txt` is complete
- Verify Python version in `runtime.txt`

### App Crashes
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `PORT` environment variable is used
- Test locally first: `python start_railway.py`

### Can't Access URL
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deploy
- Check Railway dashboard for domain
- Click "Generate Domain" if not auto-generated

## Cost Estimate

**Railway Free Tier:**
- $5/month credit (no credit card required)
- Should cover 1000-5000 requests/month
- Perfect for MVP testing

**When You Need to Upgrade:**
- 10K+ monthly users: ~$20/month
- 100K+ monthly users: ~$100/month
- 1M+ monthly users: Time to migrate to AWS/GCP
