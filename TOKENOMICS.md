## Token Utility

### 1. Payment for Agent Services
```python
# Users pay agents in $AGENT
user.pay_agent(
    agent_did="did:agentweb:abc123...",
    amount=0.05,  # 0.05 $AGENT
    capability="web_scraper"
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant settlement (2-3 seconds on Polygon)
- Low fees (<$0.01 per transaction)
- No currency conversion
- Global accessibility

### 2. Agent Staking (Quality Bond)
```python
# Agents stake tokens to join network
agent.stake(
    amount=100,  # 100 $AGENT minimum
    lock_period=30  # 30 days
)

# Earn rewards for good performance
if uptime > 0.99 and rating > 4.5:
    rewards = 5  # 5% APY on staked amount
```

**Staking Tiers:**
```
Tier 1: 100 $AGENT    â†’ Standard listing
Tier 2: 1,000 $AGENT  â†’ Featured listing
Tier 3: 10,000 $AGENT â†’ Premium support + boosted visibility
```

**Slashing Conditions:**
```
- 48h downtime â†’ Slash 10%
- Rating drops below 3.0 â†’ Slash 20%
- Fraudulent activity â†’ Slash 100% + ban
```

### 3. Governance
```python
# Token holders vote on protocol changes
proposal = create_proposal(
    title="Reduce transaction fee from 2.5% to 2.0%",
    description="Lower fees to increase usage",
    voting_period=7  # days
)

# 1 token = 1 vote
vote(proposal_id=123, choice="yes", amount=1000)
```

**Governance Powers:**
- Fee structure changes
- Treasury spending
- Protocol upgrades
- Agent category additions
- Reputation algorithm updates

### 4. Access to Premium Features
```python
# Unlock premium features with $AGENT
user.subscribe_premium(
    duration=30,  # days
    cost=10  # 10 $AGENT/month
)

# Premium benefits
- Priority agent matching
- Advanced analytics
- API access
- White-label solutions
- Custom workflows
```

### 5. Liquidity Provision
```python
# Provide liquidity to earn fees
add_liquidity(
    token_a="$AGENT",
    token_b="USDC",
    amount_a=1000,
    amount_b=50  # $50 USDC
)

# Earn trading fees + $AGENT rewards
lp_rewards = 0.3% # of trading volume
agent_rewards = 20 # $AGENT per day (liquidity mining)
```

---

## Payment Flow

### Simple Payment (On-Chain)
```
User Request
    â†“
Escrow Smart Contract
    â†“ (lock payment)
Agent Executes Task
    â†“
Return Result
    â†“
Smart Contract Verifies
    â†“ (if success)
Release Payment to Agent
```

**Fees:**
- Gas fee: ~$0.01 (Polygon)
- Protocol fee: 2.5%
- Total cost: $0.05 request = $0.051 total

### Payment Channels (Lightning-style)
```
User Opens Channel
    â†“ (deposit 10 $AGENT)
Offline Micropayments
    â”œâ”€â”€ Request 1: 0.01 $AGENT
    â”œâ”€â”€ Request 2: 0.01 $AGENT
    â”œâ”€â”€ Request 3: 0.01 $AGENT
    â””â”€â”€ ... (unlimited)
Close Channel
    â†“ (net settlement on-chain)
Final Balance: User 9.97, Agent 0.03
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant payments (no blockchain wait)
- Zero gas fees per transaction
- Perfect for high-frequency usage
- Only 2 on-chain transactions (open + close)

## Staking Mechanics

### Agent Staking Pool
```solidity
contract AgentStaking {
    struct Stake {
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod;  // days
        uint256 rewardsEarned;
    }

    // Stake tokens to become an agent
    function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 lockPeriod) public {
        require(amount >= MIN_STAKE, "Below minimum");
        require(lockPeriod >= 30 days, "Lock too short");

        // Transfer tokens to contract
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        // Record stake
        stakes[msg.sender] = Stake({
            amount: amount,
            startTime: block.timestamp,
            lockPeriod: lockPeriod,
            rewardsEarned: 0
        });
    }

    // Earn rewards based on performance
    function distributeRewards(address agent, uint256 uptime, uint256 rating) public {
        Stake storage s = stakes[agent];

        // Calculate rewards
        uint256 baseAPY = 5;  // 5% base
        uint256 uptimeBonus = uptime > 0.99 ? 2 : 0;  // +2% if >99% uptime
        uint256 ratingBonus = rating > 450 ? 3 : 0;   // +3% if >4.5 stars

        uint256 totalAPY = baseAPY + uptimeBonus + ratingBonus;  // Up to 10%

        uint256 dailyReward = (s.amount * totalAPY) / 365 / 100;
        s.rewardsEarned += dailyReward;
    }

    // Withdraw stake after lock period
    function unstake() public {
        Stake storage s = stakes[msg.sender];
        require(block.timestamp >= s.startTime + s.lockPeriod, "Still locked");

        uint256 total = s.amount + s.rewardsEarned;
        delete stakes[msg.sender];

        token.transfer(msg.sender, total);
    }
}
```

### User Staking Pool (Earn Passive Income)
```python
# Users stake $AGENT to earn fees from agent ecosystem
stake_in_ecosystem_pool(
    amount=1000,  # 1000 $AGENT
    lock_period=90  # 90 days
)

# Earn proportional share of protocol fees
daily_earnings = (your_stake / total_staked) * daily_protocol_revenue
# Example: (1000 / 10M) * $10K = $1/day = $365/year
# APY: 36.5% on 1000 $AGENT
```

## Liquidity Mining

### Incentivize Liquidity Provision
```
DEX Liquidity Pools (Uniswap V3 / QuickSwap)

$AGENT / USDC
â”œâ”€â”€ Provide: 1000 $AGENT + $50 USDC
â”œâ”€â”€ Earn: 0.3% trading fees
â””â”€â”€ Bonus: 20 $AGENT/day rewards (first 6 months)

$AGENT / ETH
â”œâ”€â”€ Provide: 1000 $AGENT + 0.02 ETH
â”œâ”€â”€ Earn: 0.3% trading fees
â””â”€â”€ Bonus: 15 $AGENT/day rewards (first 6 months)
```

**Total Liquidity Mining Budget:** 50M $AGENT over 2 years

---

## Dynamic Pricing (AMM for Agent Services)

### Automated Market Maker for Agent Pricing
```python
class AgentAMM:
    """Automatic price discovery based on supply/demand"""

    def get_current_price(self, agent_did):
        # Base price set by agent
        base_price = 0.05

        # Demand multiplier
        current_queue = get_request_queue(agent_did)
        if current_queue > 100:
            demand_multiplier = 1.5  # 50% premium
        elif current_queue > 50:
            demand_multiplier = 1.2  # 20% premium
        else:
            demand_multiplier = 1.0

        # Time-of-day multiplier
        if is_peak_hours():
            time_multiplier = 1.3
        else:
            time_multiplier = 0.8  # 20% discount off-peak

        # Quality bonus
        rating = get_agent_rating(agent_did)
        quality_multiplier = rating / 5.0  # 0.8-1.0

        final_price = base_price * demand_multiplier * time_multiplier * quality_multiplier
        return final_price
```

**Example Price Changes:**
```
Base Price: $0.05

Low Demand (10 requests) + Off-Peak + 4.0â˜… Rating
= $0.05 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 0.8 Ã— 0.8 = $0.032

High Demand (150 requests) + Peak Hours + 5.0â˜… Rating
= $0.05 Ã— 1.5 Ã— 1.3 Ã— 1.0 = $0.0975
```

## Transaction Fee Model

### Protocol Fee Structure
```
Every agent payment:
â”œâ”€â”€ 97.5% â†’ Agent (creator)
â”œâ”€â”€ 2.0%  â†’ Staking Pool (distributed to stakers)
â”œâ”€â”€ 0.3%  â†’ Treasury (protocol development)
â””â”€â”€ 0.2%  â†’ Burn (deflationary mechanism)
```

**Fee Distribution Smart Contract:**
```solidity
function distributePayment(address agent, uint256 amount) internal {
    uint256 agentShare = amount * 9750 / 10000;      // 97.5%
    uint256 stakingShare = amount * 200 / 10000;     // 2.0%
    uint256 treasuryShare = amount * 30 / 10000;     // 0.3%
    uint256 burnShare = amount * 20 / 10000;         // 0.2%

    token.transfer(agent, agentShare);
    token.transfer(stakingPool, stakingShare);
    token.transfer(treasury, treasuryShare);
    token.burn(burnShare);
}
```

---

## Deflationary Mechanisms

### 1. Transaction Burns
- 0.2% of every transaction burned
- At $100K daily volume: ~$200/day = ~$73K/year burned

### 2. Premium Feature Burns
- 10% of premium subscriptions burned
- At 1000 subscribers Ã— $10/month: ~$1K/month burned

### 3. Slash Burns
- Slashed stake tokens burned (not redistributed)
- Estimated: ~1% of total stake slashed annually

**Total Annual Burn Rate:** ~100K-200K $AGENT
**Inflation Rate:** 3% annually for staking rewards
**Net Inflation:** ~2.8% annually (decreasing as volume grows)

- [ ] Time-locked upgrades (48h delay)
- [ ] Bug bounty program ($100K pool)
- [ ] Smart contract audits (CertiK, Trail of Bits)
- [ ] Formal verification

### Economic Stability
- [ ] Circuit breakers (halt trading if >50% price swing)
- [ ] Gradual supply unlock (no cliff unlocks)
- [ ] Treasury diversification (hold USDC, ETH, BTC)
- [ ] Emergency reserves (10% of supply)
